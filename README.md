# Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
- This project aims to improve the prediction accuracy of heart disease using a combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection and Logistic Regression for classification. By selecting the most relevant features from the dataset, we enhance the performance of the classifier.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Sci-Kit Learn (scikit-learn)
  
## Dataset
 - The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 instances and 13 features.

## Usage
 1. Clone this repository:
``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/ThimalCaldera/Use-Genetic-Algorithm-to-Improve-ML-Accuracy.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
``` bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
3. Run the  script to execute the Genetic Algorithm for feature selection and improve the prediction accuracy:

- The script will output the selected features and the corresponding prediction accuracy improvement.
